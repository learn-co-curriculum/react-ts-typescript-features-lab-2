# TypeScript Features Lab 2

## Learning Goals

- Read TypeScript errors
- Fix TypeScript errors with basic TypeScript features

## The Activity

Similar to the previous lab, you're provided starter code riddled with errors.
Your goal is to run the code, read through those errors, then fix them using the
TypeScript features you just learned about.

## Instructions

We've provided a starter file for you to work in: `src/index.ts`. It contains
the starter code riddled with errors and instructions for each problem you need
to fix. Complete your work for this lab there.

To get started:

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
1. Run `npm start` to run the `src/index.ts` file.
1. Read through the errors given in your terminal to find out what is wrong with
   each problem.

Fix each problem until there are no errors left.
